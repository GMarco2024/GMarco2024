  <h1>Hi, my name is Marco Gonzalez</h1>
  <h2>🚀 Welcome to my GitHub profile!</h2>

<p>

The progression of time is granting us a closer approach to future space missions, so the need for advanced radiation protection is critical. As a Master’s Student in Health Physics at the Illinois Institute of Technology, I am dedicated to ensuring human safety in harsh environments where radiation is present. My academic work focuses on dose assessments based on ICRP Publication 103 methodologies, utilizing a custom computational tool I developed in Mathematica. Other projects in this GitHub page of mine, involve personal projects, such as a photoelectric simulator in the form of a videogame (still in progress).

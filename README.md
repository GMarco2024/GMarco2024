<h1>Hello, my name is Marco Gonzalez!</h1>

<p>

The progression of time is granting us a closer approach to future space missions, so the need for advanced radiation protection is critical. As a Master’s Student in Health Physics at the Illinois Institute of Technology, I am dedicated to ensuring human safety in harsh environments where radiation is present.

<h2>Computational Work</h2>

The purpose of this GitHub profile, is to show my current computaitonal skills. My academic work focuses on dose assessments based on ICRP Publication 103 methodologies, utilizing a custom computational tool I developed in Mathematica. Other projects in this GitHub page of mine, involve personal projects, such as a photoelectric simulator in the form of a videogame (still in progress) to be published in the form of an arcade game (one day...).
